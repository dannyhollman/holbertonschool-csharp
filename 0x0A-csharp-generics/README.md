### [0. Queue](./0-queue/)
* Create a new class called Queue<T>.


### [1. Enqueue](./1-enqueue/)
* Based on 0-queue, within Queue<T>, create a public class called Node with the following properties:


### [2. Dequeue](./2-dequeue/)
* Based on 1-enqueue, add a new method Dequeue() to the class Queue<T> that removes the first node in the queue and returns its value. 


### [3. Peek](./3-peek/)
* Based on 2-dequeue, add a new method Peek() to the class Queue<T> that returns the value of the first node of the queue without removing the node. 


### [4. Print](./4-print/)
* Based on 3-peek, add a new method Print() to the class Queue<T> that prints the queue, starting from the head.


### [5. Concatenate](./5-concatenate/)
* Based on 4-print, create a method Concatenate() that concatenates all values in the queue only if the queue is of type String or Char.
